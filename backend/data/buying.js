      'Jecka, the young man who enjoys celebrating life on the balcony with a glass of wine, every single evening. A bright little man, who is full of love for sun and nature. In his 37m² little oasis, he offers a wonderfully cut one bedroom studio apartment, that has no single lost space and is designed in a way, where one feels themselves in a much bigger place. It’s an apartment that is very bright and has a wonderful big balcony, where one can be enjoying their glass of wine in the evenings and enjoy a peaceful atmosphere, surrounded by green trees all around.',
